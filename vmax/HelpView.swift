Otherwise, Import Deck allows you to import a deck via a PTCGO output, or grab a list from Limitless right though the app (because let's be real, that's what goes on most of the time anyways). In the Limitless view, simply navigate through the archetype you'd like and select the deck you'd like to load into Pal Pad. Regardless of PTCGO or Limitless import, both will import all of the cards into a new deck, for you to rename to whatever spicy name you want.")

You can change various settings for image export such as which orientation the image is exported in, if the cards should show as stacked or not, and others.
